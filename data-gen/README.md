# Data Generator with Real Twitter Data
This directory containes a data generator that connects to the live Twitter stream, collects tweets regarding Big Data technologies, and cleans the tweets to conform to the input described in the coding challenge.  

In order to use it, you will need to have a Twitter account, then obtain Twitter OAuth credentials from [apps.twitter.com](http://apps.twitter.com) as described [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8KqeBGlWec&index=38&list=PLAwxTw4SYaPnWVpbkeoLu7WwI0JIiuXhT).  Then place these credentials in a file named '.twitter', matching the JSON format of the included '.twitter-example'. This '.twitter' file must be placed in the same directory as the 'tweet-cleaner.py' script.  **If you do post your project to Github, make sure you tell git to ignore this credentials file by using a '.gitignore' file as shown in this repo.**   

To begin collecting data, simply 'cd' to the directory containing the 'data-gen' directory from the Terminal, and run the command 'python data-gen/tweet-cleaner.py'.  This will begin collecting data and storing it in a newly created file named 'tweets.txt'.  

This data generator should work "out of the box" on most Unix and Linux systems, but you may need to adjust a few parameters or install modules (such as Tweepy) to get it to work on your system.  Alternatively, we have included a sample with 10,000 tweets for testing your solution.  You do not need to use this generator for the challenge, so do not spend ample time on it - but please email us if you have any questions.
